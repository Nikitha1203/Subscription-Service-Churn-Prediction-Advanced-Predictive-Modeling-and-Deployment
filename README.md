# Subscription-Service-Churn-Prediction-Advanced-Predictive-Modeling-and-Deployment

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end data science endeavor aimed at predicting modeling for customer churn in subscription services. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and a user-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit, it empowers businesses to proactively manage customer retention.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn based on various features, including customer information, financial data, and service usage patterns.

- **Streamlit Web Application**: Provides an interactive and intuitive web interface for users to explore predictions and gain insights directly from the predictive model.

- **Dockerized Deployment**: Ensures consistent and reproducible deployment across various environments, making it easy for developers to run the application locally or deploy it to the cloud.

- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Implements a robust continuous integration and deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions. Automates testing, building, and deployment processes for efficient development workflows.

- **Scalability**: Designed to scale effortlessly, accommodating varying workloads and supporting future growth.

## Use Cases

- **Subscription Services Providers**: Enables companies offering subscription services to identify potential churners and implement targeted strategies for customer retention.

- **Data Science Education**: Serves as an educational resource, demonstrating best practices in predictive modeling, deployment, and CI/CD workflows in a real-world context.
